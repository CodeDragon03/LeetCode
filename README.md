# LeetCode Solutions
Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions. This space is a dedicated record of my journey in mastering data structures and algorithms, with each solution reflecting my commitment to continuous learning and growth in competitive programming.

## How to Use This Repository
Each problem folder is designed to be self-contained. The solution.py file (or your preferred language) contains the complete, well-commented code. Additionally, you may find a README.md within a problem folder that provides a detailed breakdown of the thought process for that specific solution, including:

- Problem Statement: A concise summary of the problem.

- Thought Process: An explanation of the naive approach, why it is inefficient, and how to optimize it.

- Code Breakdown: A step-by-step walkthrough of the implementation.

## Contributing and Feedback
I welcome feedback and suggestions. If you find an alternative or more optimal solution to any of the problems, feel free to open a pull request. This repository is intended not just for tracking my progress but also for fostering a collaborative learning environment.
